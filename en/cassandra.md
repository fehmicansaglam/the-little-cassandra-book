## What is Cassandra?

Cassandra is a linearly scalable, decentralized NoSQL database. It provides high availability and multi data center replication with no single point of failure.

Cassandra provides a CQL(Cassandra Query Language) shell which is very similar to SQL. This makes it easy to get familiar with Cassandra. CQL shell prints data in a tabular format which is easy to read but does not represent the actual data storage format.  

Cassandra is query first. This means that you need to know your queries before modeling your data. If you do not already know your data access patterns or these patterns vary, you may need to choose a different database.
